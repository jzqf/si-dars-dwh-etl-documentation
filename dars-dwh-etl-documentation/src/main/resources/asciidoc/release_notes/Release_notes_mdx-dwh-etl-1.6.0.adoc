== Release notes for package mdx-dwh-etl-1.6.0.deb

[id="1.6.0-RN1"]
=== Script `dwh_tdp_data_mart-update.sh` added

The script `*dwh_tdp_data_mart-update.sh*` was introduced. Its purpose is to
update the TDP data mart in the data warehouse, as described in the installation
document, "Installation of the TDP data warehouse", as well as in other release
notes in the current document.


[id="1.6.0-RN2"]
=== Script `dwh_tdp_update.sh` updated

The existing script `*dwh_tdp_update.sh*` was updated so that it now performs 
the same action as if the following scripts were executed, in the order
that they are listed here:

. `dwh_tdp_mirrored_tables-update.sh`
. `dwh_tdp_data_mart-update.sh`

This change is consistent with the intended behaviour of this script that it 
should perform all actions that are appropriate for updating the entire TDP data 
warehouse.


[id="1.6.0-RN3"]
=== Script `dwh_tdp_mirrored_dynamic_tables_update.sh` removed

The script `*dwh_tdp_mirrored_dynamic_tables_update.sh*`, which was deprecated 
in v1.4.0, has been removed from the mdx-dwh-etl package.

If it is still in use, it must be replaced with the script:

 /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/scripts/dwh_tdp_mirrored_tables-update.sh


[id="1.6.0-RN4"]
=== Script `dwh_tdp_mirrored_static_tables_truncate_reload.sh` removed

The script `*dwh_tdp_mirrored_static_tables_truncate_reload.sh*`, which was deprecated 
in v1.4.0, has been removed from the mdx-dwh-etl package.

If it is still in use, it must be replaced with the script:

 /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/scripts/dwh_tdp_mirrored_tables-update.sh


[id="1.6.0-RN5"]
=== "DWH_TDP_DWH" database connection parameters renamed

The configuration parameters:

	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_HOST
	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_DATABASE
	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_PORT
	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_USERNAME
	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_PASSWORD
	
have been renamed to, respectively:
 
	DWH_TDP_MIRROR_DB_HOST
	DWH_TDP_MIRROR_DB_DATABASE
	DWH_TDP_MIRROR_DB_PORT
	DWH_TDP_MIRROR_DB_USERNAME
	DWH_TDP_MIRROR_DB_PASSWORD

These variables should be renamed in the file:
	
	/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties

In addition, the following configuration parameter has been eliminated and can 
be _removed_ from `dwh-qfree.properties`:

	DWH_TDP_DWH_DB_SCHEMA
	
These changes will not be performed automatically for you. You will need to 
modify your copy of `dwh-qfree.properties` using a text editor to make these 
changes. To view a copy of `dwh-qfree.properties` that already contains these 
changes, see the template file (used for new installations, not for upgrades):

	/opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/templates/dwh-qfree.properties
	
After modifying `/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties`, you will 
need to synchronize it with the master configuration file. This can be done from 
a shell as follows:

 $ java -jar /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/pdi_config/dwh_merge_local_properties.jar


[id="1.6.0-RN6"]
=== Mail configuration property updated

The default value for the configuration parameter:

	DWH_QF_MAIL_MSG_BODY_FAILURE

has been updated in

	/opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/templates/dwh-qfree.properties

The new default value is:

	DWH_QF_MAIL_MSG_BODY_FAILURE=The job "${PARAM_JOB_NAME}" failed.${line.separator}Job ID = ${PARAM_JOB_BATCH_ID}${line.separator}${line.separator}${DWH_QF_MAIL_BODY_FAILURE_ADDITIONAL_INFO}

Compare this new default value with the current value that is assigned to this 
parameter in the file:

	/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties ,

and update it manually, if necessary. If you do modify this file, you will 
need to synchronize it with the master configuration file. This can be done from 
a shell as follows:

 $ java -jar /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/pdi_config/dwh_merge_local_properties.jar

If you have already customized this value yourself and are satisfied with this
value, you can keep the value that you have set. The new value is only a 
sensible default.


[id="1.6.0-RN7"]
=== Java SE Runtime Environment 8 required

Although the document "Installation of the TDP data warehouse" has specified 
that JRE 8 has been required for recent releases, it was possible to run the ETL
software for managing the TDP data warehouse under a JRE 7 environment. As of 
this release, runtime errors should be expected if a JRE environment earlier 
than version 8 is used.


[id="1.6.0-RN8"]
=== 36 additional tables mirrored from the TDP Archive database

[id="1.6.0-RN9"]
=== TDP star schema data mart introduced

A data mart has been introduced for analyzing information stored in the the TDP 
archive database.

IMPORTANT: This is a work in progress - the data model will evolve over time. 
Do not expect that queries written for the data model of the current data mart 
to necessarily function correctly in the future. A future release note
will announce when the data model is stable.

The data mart is based on a star schema, using standard dimensional modeling
concepts. Only a small subset of the data in the TDP archive process is 
currently loaded into this data mart. The database currently consists of the 
following tables:

==== Data mart configuration parameters.

There are several configuration parameters that can be used to customize the TDP
data mart, as listed in the following table.

.Configuration parameters for TDP star schema data mart.
|===
|Name |Example value |Description

|*DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_DATE_YEAR_MIN* |2016 |The date dimension will start on January 1 of this year.
|*DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_DATE_YEAR_MAX* |2025 |The date dimension will end on December 31 of this year.

|[small]#*DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_TIME_RESOLUTION_SECONDS*# |1 |The resolution in seconds of the 
time dimension. This must either divide exactly into the the number of seconds 
in a minute (60) or be a multiple of 60, and at the same time it must either 
divide exactly into the the number of seconds in an hour (3600) or be a multiple 
of 3600.

|*DWH_TDP_DMA_LOCALE_LANGUAGE_CODE* |en |The two-letter
http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php[ISO 639-1] language code 
to use with the data mart. This is used together with the country code to 
specify a locale that is used to generate locale-specific strings, e.g., days 
names, month names, etc. Examples are: "*nb*" (Norwegian Bokm√•l), "*en*" 
(English), etc.

|*DWH_TDP_DMA_LOCALE_COUNTRY_CODE* |us |The two-letter 
https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/[ISO 3166-1] country code to use
with the data mart. This is used together with the language code to specify a
locale that is used to generate locale-specific strings, e.g., days names, month
names, etc. Examples are: "*no*" (Norway), "*us*" (United States of America), 
etc.

the data mart, see the documents "Installation of the TDP data warehouse" and 
"Configuration of the TDP data warehouse".


[id="1.6.0-RN10"]
=== TDP data mart database connection parameters added

Configuration parameters for the TDP star-schema data mart database have been
introduced. These are:

	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_HOST
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_DATABASE
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_PORT
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_USERNAME
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_PASSWORD
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_SCHEMA

These variables should be added to the file:
	
	/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties
	
These changes will not be performed automatically for you. You will need to 
modify your copy of `dwh-qfree.properties` using a text editor to add these 
parameters. The default values for these parameters are:

	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_HOST=localhost
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_DATABASE=dwh_tdp_db
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_PORT=5432
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_USERNAME=etl
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_PASSWORD=etl
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DB_SCHEMA=dma

If you do not add entries for these parameters in 
`/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties`, then the default values will 
be used.
	
After modifying `/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties`, you will 
need to synchronize it with the master configuration file. This can be done from 
a shell as follows:

 $ java -jar /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/pdi_config/dwh_merge_local_properties.jar


[id="1.6.0-RN11"]
=== Data mart date dimension parameters renamed

The configuration parameters:

	DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_TIME_YEAR_MIN
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_TIME_YEAR_MAX

have been renamed, respectively, to:

	DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_DATE_YEAR_MIN
	DWH_TDP_DMA_DIM_DATE_YEAR_MAX

You will need to make this change in your local configuration file:

	/etc/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/q-free/dwh-qfree.properties .

After this change is made, you need to synchronize this file with the master 
configuration file. This can be done from a shell as follows:

 $ java -jar /opt/dwh/mdx-dwh-etl/pdi_config/dwh_merge_local_properties.jar

Although initial data mart functionality was just added in the v1.6.0 release, 
these configuration parameters were already present in previous releases.
